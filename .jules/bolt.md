## 2024-05-23 - Python Overhead in Micro-optimizations **Learning:** Precomputing values to avoid function calls can sometimes backfire if the overhead of managing the cache (dictionaries, sets, loops) in Python exceeds the cost of the function calls, especially if those function calls are already efficient (e.g., using caching internally). **Action:** When optimizing loop interiors, minimize Python control flow. Moving invariant set construction to `__init__` recovered the performance gain.
